DevExtreme Reactive supported Material-UI, Bootstrap 3 and 4 themes.

DevExtreme React includes [built-in themes](/concepts/60%20Themes%20and%20Styles/05%20Predefined%20Themes/00%20Predefined%20Themes.md '/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Predefined_Themes/'): Generic, Material, and Fluent. To simplify migration, you can switch to one of them.

If our built-in themes do not meet your requirements, you can use our [ThemeBuilder](/concepts/60%20Themes%20and%20Styles/08%20ThemeBuilder/01%20Get%20Started/3%20Create%20a%20New%20Theme.md '/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/ThemeBuilder/#Get_Started/Create_a_New_Theme') tool to create a custom theme.
