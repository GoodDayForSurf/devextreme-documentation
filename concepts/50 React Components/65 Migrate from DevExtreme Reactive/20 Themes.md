DevExtreme Reactive supported Material-UI, Bootstrap 3 and 4 themes.

DevExtreme React includes [built-in themes](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Predefined_Themes/): Generic, Material, and Fluent. To simplify migration, you can switch to one of them.

If our built-in themes do not meet your requirements, you can use our [ThemeBuilder](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/ThemeBuilder/#Get_Started/Create_a_New_Theme) tool to create a custom theme.
